Please note when you buy from us you are buying \u2018collectible\u2019 goods which may have been in circulation for years, and in some cases, decades. Nothing on this site is labelled as \u201cbrand new\u201d. You could expect to see imperfections (marks on bottles, minor tears to labels, marks on boxes, dents in tubes and other minor imperfections) on any item that is purchased from this site. No returns will be accepted as faulty or damaged goods if they are simply showing their age. We will accept returns if the goods are returned in exactly the same condition as they were shipped.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We provide high-resolution images of all our products \u2013 please satisfy yourself as to their condition before placing an order. If you require additional images before purchasing, please&nbsp;contact us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>CANCELLING YOUR ORDER<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Your right to cancel an order for goods starts the moment you receive your goods and ends 14 days from that day. You must inform<a href=\"https:\/\/japanesekings.com\/\"> the rare Japanese and Scotch Whisky Shop<\/a> as soon as you decide to cancel your order.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have decided to cancel an order, you have a further 14 days to return the items to us. You must use a reputable and trackable service for instance DHL, ParcelForce, or Fedex. If you are returning goods that are not faulty we are obliged to refund the original delivery charge but we are not obliged to cover your return postage costs. We can assist in using our DHL account for returns to help get the goods returned to us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your return is received and inspected, we will send you an email to notify you that we have received your returned item(s). For your refund to be approved we must receive the goods in good condition within the timeframe specified above. Deductions can be made (potentially to zero) where goods have been returned to us in an unsatisfactory or unsaleable condition. This includes items which have been damaged in transit due to incorrect or insufficient packaging.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your refund is approved we will process a refund within 5 days. Please note that credit card companies and banks typically delay crediting funds to your account by several days after the refund has been initiated by ourselves and this is beyond our control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please do not send your purchase back to the manufacturer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Faulty, damaged goods<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Defective or damaged items will be exchanged if there is a suitable replacement available. Please contact us immediately if you receive faulty or damaged goods. Many of our items are irreplaceable in the short term and therefore we will work with you to find an acceptable solution in those cases.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Return shipping<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To return your product, you should first notify us by phone or email, then we would guide you o, how to ship back to us.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Rare Japanese And Scotch Whisky Shop is a specialist retailer of vintage whiskies.
