Owning a bottle will instantly move any collection into the ranks of the worlds most elite.<\/p>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Introducing The World\u2019s Oldest Yamazaki Release<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">In early 2020 Suntory announced that it would be releasing a whisky fit for the history books, a Yamazaki Single Malt that had been aged for more than 55 years. The whisky captures the craftsmanship of more than a half century of distilling expertise, combining three iconic casks to create an expression that is second to none.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Combining Three Generations Of Distilling Expertise<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">The first cask was distilled in 1960 by Yamazki\u2019s founder, Shinjiro Torii, and carefully aged in mizunara oak. The second and third casks were distilled in 1961 and 1964 by Suntory\u2019s second master blender Keizo Saji, then aged in American white oak. The three casks were selected and blended by chief blender Shinji Fukuyo in concert with Shinjiro Torri\u2019s grandson, the third-generation master blender Shingo Torii.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">\u201cThroughout the process of blending Yamazaki 55, I used as inspiration the passage of time and wabi-sabi\u2014the Japanese belief that imperfections can help to ultimately contribute to perfection,\u201d Fukuyo said in a press release. \u201cWhile I often view other extra aged whiskies as art, I consider Yamazaki 55 to be more like a Buddhist statue: calm and mysterious, requiring time to truly enjoy inner beauty.\u201d<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Whisky Unlike Any Other<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">The Yamazaki 55 Year Old is so special that Suntory has said a normal tasting glass isn\u2019t good enough, but that a Burgundy glass be used instead in order to take in the full array of notes that this complex whisky has to offer. It takes an exceptional level of skill to work with well aged whisky in order to retain the distinguishing notes while minimizing any overbearing flavors that can overpower the palate. With this release the Suntory team demonstrates their unparalleled expertise by bringing forth a plethora of notes that are unlike any other whisky that has ever been produced.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">With this expression, you get hints of fresh-cut grass in addition to more tropical flavors such as nearly-ripe mangoes, orange zest, ginger chews\u2014all blanketed by the influence of the mizunara, which imparts subtle notes of bitter citrus rinds, sandalwood, cedar shavings, and a tinge of sweetness that\u2019s enhanced by the whisky\u2019s mildly saccharine and lasting finish.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Intricate &amp; Beautiful Design<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">The Yamazaki 55 Year Old features an impeccable design that is inspired by Japanese art and culture, bringing forth a level of meticulous detail that is a true masterpiece. The bottles were produced with engraved calligraphy that made use of intricate sandblasting techniques, while incorporating genuine gold dust and real lacquer. The result is an elegant presentation piece that perfectly complements the liquid contained within and will truly stand apart among even the most prized collections.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Includes Miniature Bottle<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\">Note that this is the Japan release which includes an exclusive miniature bottle along with the full size bottle. This makes this particular expression among the most rare Yamazaki releases of all time.<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Distillery:<\/strong> Yamazaki<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Whisky Origin:<\/strong> Japanese<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Single Malt:<\/strong> Yes<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Alcohol Strength:<\/strong> 46%<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Bottle Size:<\/strong> 70cl<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Box:<\/strong> Yes<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><strong>Weight:<\/strong> 2 Kg<\/div>\n<div dir=\"auto\"><\/div>\n","protected":false},"featured_media":704,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"product_cat":[44],"product_tag":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.1 -
